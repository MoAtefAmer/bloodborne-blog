## Main Strategy
Although many people find this boss hard, I find this boss quite easy as I killed him on the 2nd try only. The difficulty of this boss lies in his beast form phase, other than that he is extremely easy to handle. Your main course of action in this fight is to first learn how to parry. When you are somewhat decent at the parrying mechanic in the game proceed to fight this boss. All you have to do is just dodge and fish for parries and inflict visercal attacks and you will easily get him down to 40% health. 

After that his beast form emerges, you should be dodging 90% of the time and only fish for attacks when it is super safe and manage your stamina quite well and do not overextend. One wrong step will result in death.

An alternative to beating his beast form is to spam molotov cocktails since he will be taking extra damage since he becomes a beast.


## Alternative Strategy
There is an exploit/cheese where you can make him get stuck on the stairs and you will be able to attack him but he cant attack you through the stairs fence.


## Helper Items
As we mentioned molotov cocktails are essential for his beast phase. Also pair that with oil urns for greater damage.
