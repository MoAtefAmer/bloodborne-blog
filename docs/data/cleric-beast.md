### Beast of the clergy



<br /> 

## Primary Strategy

When facing the formidable Cleric Beast in Bloodborne, the wisest course of action is to capitalize on a crucial piece of intelligence; the creature's stance may be shattered with relative ease. By directing three bullets straight at the creature's head, his stance can be consistently rendered vulnerable, allowing for visceral damage to be inflicted.

It is important to note that this technique has a cooldown, which is reset when the beast enters its healing animation. Additionally, the Cleric Beast has two distinct modes: calm and enraged. The latter is triggered by substantial damage and subsequently resets. During the calm mode, evasive maneuvers should be employed to dodge the creature's attacks, rolling to the side and attempting to land attacks from behind during the cooldown. Conversely, during the enraged mode, maintaining a safe distance is paramount, avoiding any stray swing attacks that could prove deadly.

## Helper Items

Given that the Cleric Beast is a beast-type enemy, it is highly susceptible to fire damage. Thus, items such as Molotov cocktails with Oil Urns can prove devastatingly effective. Moreover, the Cleric Beast is an early-game boss and comparatively weak, further amplifying the effectiveness of fire-based attacks.

## Rewards
Emerging victorious in battle against the Cleric Beast unlocks the Kirkhammer in the shop for a modest sum of 3000 bloodechoes. The Kirkhammer is widely regarded as one of the most potent strength weapons in the game and a valuable asset to players pursuing a strength build. Its sheer power and utility earn it a well-deserved S-tier ranking
