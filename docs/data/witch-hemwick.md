## Main Strategy
This fight can be really easy or really hard depending on you. If you act quickly and do not give her a chance to spawn here minions it will be a piece of cake. At the start of the battle you will have to kill the first minion in order to be able to start fighting the witch.
Once you kill the first minion sprint all over the map until you find the witch (she will be invisible but will be revelaed when you get closer)

When you find her you should attack her with all you got, preferabbly with staggering attacks as they prevent her from casting any spells.
When she teleports you should sprint and try to find her again and do that rinse and repeat.

## Things to watch out for
Firstly, watch out for her forcefield attack, it does a lot of aoe damage and might hurt you if you get too close. 
Secondly, the second body of the witch casts a blue projectile, you should dodge it at all costs. This projectile is a snare that will keep you in your place for at least 6 seconds which is more than enough time for hear to tear your eyeballs out (quite literally!!).

Thirdly, be mindful that you should be really fast and on your feet in this fight because the second body of the witch can revive the first body so speed is key in this fight.

Finally, watch out of the occasional runner. The minions that the witch spawns you should try to avoid and target the witch herself, if you are fast enough she shouldnt be able to spawn any minions but if thats not the case then you will most probably run around the ones that spawned and attack the witch since they move slow. However, often on or more of these minions will start running super fast towards you when you are going for the witch so watch your back as you can die a very frustrating death as a result.


## Helper Items
Blood beast pellets are very good in this fight since they give you more damage output at the cost of taking more damage, however since you can technically not get touched in this fight since the witch's attacks are very slow and can be canceled by staggering attacks, this is a very advantageous oppurtuniity for using this item

## Rewards
You will receive 12000 blood echoes and if you go further inside the tunnel, you will find a rune workshop tool which will allow you to equip global runes to your character.
